<p>I finally gave in to the FOMO of having my own blog. Things I like in blogs:</p>
<p>No one can comment.</p>
<p>Having my own blog was something that I had in my TODO list for quite a while. Deciding on the content though is of course a task of its own.
And because I am lazy, this first blog post is going to be about how I set up this blog!</p>
<p><img src="/images/spiderman.jpeg" alt="see what I did there?"></p>
<h4 id="step-0">Step 0</h4>
<p>First things first: I was wondering whether I should be hosting this in a cloud provider&rsquo;s object storage service (like AWS S3) but then
I remembered something: I don&rsquo;t really like paying. Also, some cloud horror stories I come across sometimes (like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1b14bty/netlify_just_sent_me_a_104k_bill_for_a_simple/">this one</a>)
make me extra cautious. Plus on the bright side, I would understand how things work better without having the comfortable cloud abstractions in place.</p>
<h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>
<p>So I bought a raspberry pi that I could use as a server. Which is also something I wanted to buy either way (or I was simply looking for an excuse to buy one).</p>
<h4 id="step-2">Step 2</h4>
<p>Find a domain: johnmantios.fyi was a cheap option (not for long though&hellip;)</p>
<h4 id="step-3">Step 3</h4>
<p>Use a dynamic DNS service: because I am not paying my ISP for a static IP, I had to find a way to overcome this. I chose
a free service called no-ip which essentially points my router&rsquo;s dynamic IP address to a static hostname: no-ip checks
every 5 minutes for changes to my router&rsquo;s IP address. If the latter changes, then no-ip updates the hostname I have chosen
with the new IP address.</p>
<h4 id="step-4">Step 4</h4>
<p>Create a CNAME record: In the domain registrar from which I bought my domain, I added a CNAME record which forwards traffic
from my domain to my no-ip domain.</p>
<h4 id="step-5">Step 5</h4>
<p>Assign a static IP to my raspberry pi: In order to do that, I had to connect my raspberry pi to my router through an
ethernet cable. Every ethernet device has a unique MAC address. So I opened up my router&rsquo;s settings and I assigned my rpi&rsquo;s MAC
address a specific IP. Also known as a DHCP rule.</p>
<h4 id="step-6">Step 6</h4>
<p>Still in the router: add port forwarding rules. Redirect packets to specific ports from which your rpi will serve your html content.</p>
<h4 id="step-7">Step 7</h4>
<p>Sneaky step: make sure with your ISP that there is no carrier grade NAT sitting behind your router&rsquo;s IP.</p>
<h4 id="step-8">Step 8</h4>
<p>rpi: ssh into your rpi server and install nginx. Also execute certbot or acme commands in order to obtain your SSL/TLS certificate.
Of course, you can automate this in 1000 different ways but this greatly depends on the time and effort you want to put.</p>
<h4 id="step-9">Step 9</h4>
<p>serve your application: start nginx and serve your html files. In my case I am using hugo as a static site generator</p>
