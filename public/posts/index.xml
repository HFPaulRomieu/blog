      <description>Introduction I finally gave in to the FOMO of having my own blog. Things I like in blogs:&#xA;No one can comment.&#xA;Having my own blog was something that I had in my TODO list for quite a while. Deciding on the content though is of course a task of its own. And because I am lazy, this first blog post is going to be about how I set up this blog!</description>
